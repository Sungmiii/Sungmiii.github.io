                        <h3>1. How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
                        <p>
                            My pleasure of the life is simple which I finish something  on time, 
                            for example when I worked as a barista at the small retail shop and 
                            I only work there. I was busy at the lunch time at all the time and 
                            customers are lined up but I managed to serve all then I felt super proud 
                            of me and this is the one of my life pleasure experience. 
                            <br>
                            About my passion, hmmm I do have passion to do something like I am studying 
                            again from October last year and that was a hard decision but I wanted to 
                            settle down in New Zealand, also want to work! This passion push me hard 
                            sometimes and make me worried so much but I am tried to do something everyday 
                            to get there.
                            <br>
                            My higher purpose is to be a happy person, not a grumpy person & miserable. 
                            I am 31 but am still struggling with the same reason when I was teenagers. 
                            I hope to be the happy person one day. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>2. From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, 
                            What are your core values? &nbsp;What do you stand for?</h3>
                        <p>
                            My core values is the family and how we gonna live happily. 
                            My family is living in Korea, and I only live here with my 
                            partner who will be family next year, haha!  
                            So I want to make my family in New Zealand and live happily!.
                            <br>
                            I stand for the adventurer, I lived in my country for entire my 
                            life before coming here and never lived without my family.

                        <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Meditation exercise is working well this chapter. I just bit stuck 
                            in the failure moment though, my biggest failure was happened when 
                            I was 17 and this failure memory changed my personality until now and 
                            really difficult to throw away this.

                        <p>
                            I am doing Learning Optimism my self, do not upload anything on facebook 
                            and instagram. I know most people love to do that but this social media 
                            kind of fake to me, everyone too nice or too sad at all the time. I prefer 
                            to talk in person or texting about my feeling. I am not sure this is fit 
                            to the learning optimism but it works me anyway. 
                        </p>
