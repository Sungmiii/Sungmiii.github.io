        <h1>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h1>
        <p>'Pomodoro Technique'&amp;'How to Create a Habit' and 'The Power of Meditation' those three I've tried before. </p>
        <h1>what did you find interesting?</h1>
        <p>I actually surprise that 'Pomodoro Technique' is working, because it's never worked me at all.
           I am not able to concentrate if there is the time limit at the each section, I prefer to make
           a time line each day and it makes me comfortable.
        </p>
        <h1>what worked for you?</h1>
        <p>'How to Create a Habit' it's worked for me mostly. I tried to wake up at the same time everyday and 
            starting study at the similar time. However if I wake up late and didn't start studying at the similar 
            time, feel really guilty and nervous.
        </p>
        <h1>which will you experiment further with?</h1>
        <p>I should try'The Power of Meditation' to calm down when I feel very nervous and guilty. Maybe try a yoga with.</p>
