                <h3>JavaScrpit Language</h3>
                <h4>1. What is parentheses <span class="parentheses">( )</span> doing for in JavsScript?</h4>
                <p>
                    You are able to see lots of <span class="parentheses">( )</span> in JavsScript code,
                    and there is curiosity that what are they doing for?
                    In <span class="parentheses">Function</span> it's used for excuting the function code.
                    If you read my JavaScript-basic blog there is example of how to use the function and you don't want
                    to reapeat this function code at all the time just simply you can call yourfunction with <span
                        class="parentheses">()</span>.
                    <br>
                    You also use <span class="parentheses">( )</span> for the condititonal statement and the looping
                    statement.
                    In this time you add content in the <span class="parentheses">( )</span>, for example if you want
                    to give a condtion, you write down
                    your condition inside of <span class="parentheses">( )</span> after if.
                </p>
                <h4>2. What is brackets <span class="brackets">[ ]</span> doing for in JavsScript?</h4>
                <p>
                    We are using the bracktets for array, what is array? Array is the list basket if I say simly
                    explaining.
                    For examply, I need list for my favorite movie then I could make <span class="brackets">movieList =
                        ['Harry Potter', 'Inception', 'Iron man-1']</span>.
                    Also if you want to select one movie from my list, using <span class="brackets">[ ]</span>.
                    Wait, How? Array has a index property, so my movie list has a index number each 'Harry Potter' has
                    index 0,
                    'Inception' has index 1 and 'Ironman-1' has index 2. Yes, it starts from 0, please don't confuse
                    with the length.
                    So we could select 'Harry Potter' with <span class="brackets">movieList[0]</span>
                </p>
                <h4>3. What is brace <span class="brace">{ }</span> doing for in JavsScript?</h4>
                <p>
                    We are using brace for Object and enclose blocks of code(function,loop,condition etc),
                    I am talking about the object mainly because it's very important to use the object in JavsScript.
                    When I mentioned about my movieList there is characters in the movie, right? So I want to make a
                    list
                    each my favorite movie this time I am using <span class="brace">{ }</span>.
                    <span class="brace">chracterList = {"Harry Potter":{"Name":"Harry Potter", "Role":"Main Character",
                        "Actor":"Daniel Radcliffe"},
                        "Iron man-1":{"Name":"Tony Stark", "Role":"Main Character", "Actor":"Robert Downey, Jr."}}</span>
                    like this.
                    Yes, You can add object in object even you can add array in object, very cool and confusing haha!
                    How can you select 'Actor's name? It's simply we are using <span class="brackets">[ ]</span> and
                    dot.
                    So We could select <span class="brackets">chracterList["Harry Potter"].Actor</span> or you can use
                    <span class="brackets">[Actor]</span> as well.

                </p>

                <h4>4. What is single quotes <span class="single">' '</span> & double quotes <span class="double">" "</span>
                    doing for in JavsScript?s</h4>
                <p>
                    We use the single quotes for stiring(text), you see the above I wrote the Harry Potter with <span
                        class="single">' '</span> in array list.
                    Also you can see I used <span class="double">" "</span> as well, you are able to use both for
                    string. But how about
                    you want to change your text in a new line also js.file read your <span class="single">' '</span>
                    as a code but you only use for like [he's].
                    That time we use <span class="single">' '</span>, for example <span class="single">'A string
                        that\'s single quoted'</span> slash is saying to
                    our computer "hey this single quote is not for string another string".
