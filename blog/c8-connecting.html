                            for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am trying to trust me more than before, 2 month ago I didn’t 
                            know how to use Github, html and css but I am now able to use 
                            and understand. I know hey there JavaScript… I need more time 
                            with you as you are quite tough one, haha! So, going well so far!

                        <p>
                                Well, this is another weakness part of me, but I am trying 
                                to correct this weakness. I an kind of the person, don’t feel 
                                kindness to people maybe because I hurt feeling from people 
                                when I was teenager and this memory still with me. I know that 
                                am not anymore teen but bad memory is never forgotten. However 
                                I need to correct about feeling other people mind as well, 
                                because I don’t want to hurt their feeling. So, I am currently 
                                trying to listen people’s mind and not to interrupt until they 
                                finish their talk.

                        <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                        <p>
                                It’s alright, I used this meditation thinking about my mom in 
                                Korea who cares about me until our life ends, also thinking about 
                                her feeling without me in Korea. She is calling everyday and I 
                                don’t like that much because feel like still children. However 
                                I am her child, it won’t be changed and she will concern about 
                                me forever. I hope she is not worried about me too much though, her 
                                life is once like me, so hope she has a happy life and not too worry.

                        <p>
                            I had a best friend from the high school and we suddenly 
                            become no friend about 10 years ago? I still don’t understand 
                            why she stop contacting me at all. I haven’t seen her … yes 
                            more than 10 years but after this situation, I don’t trust 
                            people and very difficult to make a friend who I could call friend. 
                            The funny thing was one of my friend met her in the street and 
                            asked to my friend to tell me “Sorry?”. Very curious about that 
                            talk but I was in New Zealand that time so no change to ask for why.
