                        <p>
                            It has been less than 2 weeks for starting Phase 0 
                            and rarely started Sprint-1 from last weekend. It was 
                            very stressed out even just reading about Github but 
                            now I am enjoying Github so I am very excited to do 
                            continue and what I am gonna learn next Sprint.

                        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I impressed how Shereef answered about question very well. 
                            He explained each question smoothly, it’s not easy to me 
                            get the answer at once as English is not my first language 
                            but he explained very well.

                        <p>
                            I am proud of myself because it was tough to me decide to 
                            study again but I want to settle down in New Zealand safely 
                            and want to get a job which I can study at all the time.

                        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Nothing changed yet so far, just bit difficult to concentrate 
                            watching this video because audio is off and on my laptop and 
                            video quality is bit low. Maybe my internet is quite slow to 
                            play this video.

                        <p>
                            It’s excited to learn about the coding Does it make you nervous? 
                            It made me nervous even before I’ve started but getting know 
                            something about coding so far and it makes me little bit comfortable.

                            <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
                            <p>
                                'Pomodoro Technique'&amp;'How to Create a Habit' 
                                 and 'The Power of Meditation' those three I've tried before.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                I actually surprise that 'Pomodoro Technique' is working, because it's never worked me at all.
                                I am not able to concentrate if there is the time limit at the each section, I prefer to make
                                a time line each day and it makes me comfortable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                'How to Create a Habit' it's worked for me mostly. I tried to wake up at the same time everyday and 
                                starting study at the similar time. However if I wake up late and didn't start studying at the similar 
                                time, feel really guilty and nervous.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I should try'The Power of Meditation' to calm down when I feel very nervous and guilty. 
                                Maybe try a yoga with.

                            <p>
                                Firstly, reading is my weakenss because I am not able to concentrate with too many
                                english but I try to train my brain to read through chapter 1. Hopefully my brain 
                                is tranied well for next sprint to read more.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I take the easy way to do this, and it's not working yet becuae I am still paying
                                attention to the noise of the outside construction. I will try few times more.
