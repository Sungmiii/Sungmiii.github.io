        <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
            <p>It has been less than 2 weeks for starting Phase 0 
                and rarely started Sprint-1 from last weekend. It was very stressed 
                out even just reading about Github but now I am enjoying Github so 
                I am very excited to do continue and what I am gonna learn next Sprint.</p>
        <li>What are your impressions?</li> 
            <p>I impressed how Shereef answered about question very well. He explained 
                each question smoothly, it’s not easy to me get the answer at once as 
                English is not my first language but he explained very well. </p>  
        <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
            <p>I am proud of myself because it was tough to me decide to study again but 
            I want to settle down in New Zealand safely and want to get a job which 
            I can study at all the time. </p>
        <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</li>
            <p>Nothing changed yet so far, just bit difficult to concentrate 
                watching this video because audio is off and on my laptop and 
                video quality is bit low. Maybe my internet is quite slow to play this video.</p>
        <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</li>
            <p>It’s excited to learn about the coding Does it make you nervous? 
                It made me nervous even before I’ve started but getting know something
                 about coding so far and it makes me little bit comfortable.</p>
