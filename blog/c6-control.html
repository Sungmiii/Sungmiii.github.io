                        <h3>1. When programming, what are some of your triggers? 
                            What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am learning JavaScript for design and build the website looking cool, 
                            hence my triggers are when I visit the website built very cooly, also I 
                            am able to see their code luckily with the Dev tool(thank you my friend). 
                            Another trigger is some people asked me to how to do What I have done. 
                            I am not good at explaining seriously but when I get the question, am tried 
                            to explain to them even it takes a long time. <br>
                            I am not sure what is exactly the disproportionate emotional meaning so far. 
                            I hope my answer is correct otherwise this answer would be the disproportionate 
                            emotional? I am currently studying web & graphic design at Yoobee design school 
                            and having lots of communication with my classmate specially right next to me. 
                            I misunderstood my classmate’s question often due to the language so it becomes 
                            very awkward situation because I didn’t response correctly and I figured out at 
                            the last what was the question. So my classmate would misunderstand my response 
                            and I noticed after time has gone.

                        <h3>2. How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
                        <p>
                           When I start reading this part, I found out that trigger was not that trigger
                            what I understood. My bad, this is my emotional trigger when I found out 
                            ‘Argn… again but fine, I know now’. SBNRR practice is good to calm down my anger, 
                            I got angry quickly and sometime am not able to stop crying at the same time. 
                            So I hope this SBNRR helping me to calm down when I am in the awkward situation 
                            with my partner because I don’t want to hurt his feeling.
