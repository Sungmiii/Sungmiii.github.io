                <h3>Javascript Basic</h3>
                <h4>1. How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is making our website actively. We are able to make a navigation menu
                    with html(foundation), give a style with CSS(color,size etc) and give a dropdown
                    animation with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
                    life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has the different statements, we are sleeping everyday, are waking up
                    on the following day and are brushing our teeth(hopefully). We can use if statement
                    for waking up like <span class="t4span">if(var person === wake up in the morning)</span> and add
                    for statement
                    for looping like <span class="t4span">for(var person = 0; person &lt; 80years; person++)</span>.
                    JavaScript will execute this code until person ages at 79.
                </p>
                <h4>3. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
                <p>
                    Array is collecting multiple datas and assigned with a single variable, for example
                    dog breeds is a variable and accessing Chihuahua, Rottweiler, Beagel...etc. You are able
                    to change the dog breeds to the cat breeds with cat breeds's data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Object is similar to Arrays but you are able to add different value to each properties.
                    For example, mydog is a variable, mydog has name property and name value is Scipio.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Explain what functions are and why they are useful?</h4>
                <p>
                    Function concept is same as math function(I don't like math, by the way), if function is a box
                    and you input something and output your result and you can use this function repeatedly. For
                    example,
                    function is a oven with 200 degrees for 20mins , you input pizza then your output is a delicious
                    pizza!
                </p>
                <h4>5. The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h4>
                <p>
                    It's was difficult becaues I could do place my navbar vertically but their height was
                    same height as my ul elements but I want to give them a full height.
                    So I found hint from w3schools. But I have a problem to give a responsive nav bar
                    for the mobile viersion, it looks still not a stable...
