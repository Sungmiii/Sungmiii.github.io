                        CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>

                            <li class="udareply">html is the language of the web and it's called a 'tag',basically
                                I can say it's basement for building the website.

                    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
                    <p>Webpage is built up with lots of boxes, we only can see image,
                        color and text but actually these contents are surrouned by each
                        boxes.The Webdevlopers are drawing boxes on the paper first, where
                        is head and where is body and where is footer then they are doing
                        html,css and JavaScript.

                    <p>The box model is the important to understand html,
                        when we write down tag 'p' it's in a box. So P is tag 
                        and has a content with that and content is surrouned by padding
                        and padding is also surrouned by border and lastly they are all surrouned
                        by margin. The padding is the inside of the box and the margin is the outside
                        of the box.
